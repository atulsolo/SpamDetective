# Spam Detective



An advanced machine learning-based system for detecting and filtering spam emails from legitimate ones. This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques for feature extraction, such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF, and applies classification algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to achieve high accuracy in spam detection. The model is trained on a publicly available email dataset and is designed to improve email security and user experience.

Key features:

Preprocessing steps: text cleaning, tokenization, and stemming.
Feature extraction: BoW, TF-IDF, and n-grams.
Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
Easy to integrate into email systems for real-time spam filtering.
